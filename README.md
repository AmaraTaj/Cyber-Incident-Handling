🛡️ Cyber-Incident-Handling

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an Advanced Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP) that integrates cutting-edge tools, technologies, and frameworks to detect, contain, and recover from cyber incidents efficiently.

It also includes a ransomware attack simulation based on the MITRE ATT&CK profile for BlackByte Ransomware ([S1180](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1180/)), complete with:
- Detailed Incident Report
- Verified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Mitigation & Recovery Techniques
- Lessons Learned
- A Professional Webpage Showcasing the Simulation

🎯 Objectives
Develop a structured and efficient incident response plan.
Simulate a real-world ransomware attack scenario for training purposes.
Demonstrate threat detection, containment, eradication, and recovery procedures.
Present the simulation in an interactive and professional webpage format.
Share findings and best practices for future defense.
